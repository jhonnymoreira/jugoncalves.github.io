Or choosing your abstraction wisely

We all know that JavaScript used to be an almost-impossible-to-deal programming language. We also know all its history and stuff, nothing new here. Things have started getting better after the version 5. Now using the version 6 (with Google's Traceur, obviously), I can almost say it's enjoyable to program using JavaScript. :) 

But it still keeps some of its *bad parts*. Mostly because it **cannot** be fixed without breaking backwards compatibility. Working websites and webapps cannot just stop working because of it. It's not acceptable.
